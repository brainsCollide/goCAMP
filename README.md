This is the first fullstack web app that i build from my time when i took the Web Development Bootcamp from Udemy.
This web app uses backend frameworks such as Node.JS, Exress JS and mongoDB database that could storse user data and informations.
Uses other APIs like cloudinary to store the uploaded photos and Mapbox to show Geo locations

I am thrilled to do another Fullstack projects as this is my fist step to something great
